# My Markdown Example

## Headings

You can create headings in Markdown by using one or more hash symbols (#). The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading, with one hash symbol indicating a top-level heading and up to six hash symbols indicating a subheading.

### Subheadings

Subheadings can be nested by using more hash symbols.

## Lists

You can create ordered lists by using numbers:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

And unordered lists by using asterisks or dashes:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Links

You can create links in Markdown by using brackets and parentheses:

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)

## Images

You can embed images in Markdown by using exclamation points, brackets, and parentheses:

![OpenAI logo](https://openai.com/content/images/2020/07/openai_logo--full.svg)

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis to text by using asterisks or underscores:

*Italic text*

**Bold text**

## Code

You can include inline code by using backticks (`) and code blocks by using triple backticks:

`print("Hello, world!")`
